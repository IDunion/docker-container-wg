### Tagging scheme for Containers

- indy_node:latest = indy_node:buster


Assuming 0.1.2 is the latest release:
- indy_node:buster = indy_node:v0.1-buster
- indy_node:v0.1-buster = indy_node:v0.1.2-buster
- indy_node:v0.1.2-buster
- indy_node:v0.1.0-buster
- indy_node:my_fancy_branch-buster

similar for ubuntu
