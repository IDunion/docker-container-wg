Updates

- [Issues with the running GS1 Container (our buster image) in the ID Union Test Network](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/10) are under investigation
  - See https://hackmd.io/GSJnYPt0Q9yFKgoNGWtcMw for live update of current findings
  - Guido is running the buster image for some month in a test network (few 100 transactions) without problems.
  - Hakan and Patrick are currently using our ubuntu 18 container in a test network together with ubuntu 16 vms. This should reproduce the issue in IDU if it is related to the container.
