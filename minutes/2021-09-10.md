Updates
---

- [Issues with the running GS1 Container (our buster image) in the ID Union Test Network](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/10) investigation closed
  - Black box testing:
    - Starting an ubuntu 16 (deb packages) image without wiping the ledger does NOT fix the consensus issue
    - after wipe and re sync (delete data dri and restart) the issue resolves. See also 
    - See https://hackmd.io/GSJnYPt0Q9yFKgoNGWtcMw for findings (please add new ones)
  - Ask indy contributors!
    - Still 2do @Echsecutor !

- Fixing the identified container issues (write consensus)
  -  https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/38 !
  -  Decision of today: Focus resources on ubuntu 20 pipeline (see below) instead of building new images based on the ubuntu 16 deb files

  
- Issue 32 (mount logs) and 35 (test ledger on pull request) are WIP in https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/pull/36 @Echsecutor 
  - Still no progress since last week!
  - Seperate PRs for issues
  - Guido to help with the testing issue

Ubuntu 20 CI/CD
-----------

- We decided to help Robin to get the CI/CD for the Ubuntu 20 debs into indy in order to use those for our image builds. Those should be useful for fixing https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/38
- See here: https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/39 for a list of Robins PRs that are waiting for review!
