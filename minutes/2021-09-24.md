Updates
---

- [Issue#35: Ledger test not testing the PR version of the containers](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/35) 
  - Guido created a PR that combines all pipelines into one workflow that builds the images first, tests the images, and then publishes the images if all tests pass. The PR makes use of the matrix functionality for `ubuntu16`, `ubuntu18`, and `buster`
  - The PR#40 is at https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/pull/40/files
  - Robin and Niclas will review the PR by Monday (2021-09-20)
  - Thanks to Guido for the PR!!!

Ubuntu 20 CI/CD
-----------

- CI/CD pipeline for Indy-Node and Indy-Plenum are completed


Indy-Test-Automation
-----------
- [Issue#102: Indy Node system tests depend on the Sovrin package](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation/issues/102) 
    - The next step towards the release of the Ubuntu20.04 debian files and PyPi packages is to remove the Sovrin dependencies from `indy-test-automation`
    - Robin will create a draft PR. Sebastian will support if resources are available

Node Control
-----------
- [Issue#8: node_controller currently not runnning](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/issues/8) 
    - The group decided to focus on the restart rather than the update functionality first
        - Restart is easier to implement and more important is it is used more often
        - Update is far more complex to implement and will probably happen just a couple of times each year
    - Open question: Is it possible to start supervisor in a rootless container?
    - Niclas will describe the issue in more detail and defines concrete next steps
